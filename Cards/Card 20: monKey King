Card 20: monKey King - Self proclaimed monkey king on a journey to the West. It is said he found a secret place on his way and released an ancient evil but he claims to never have seen any non-monKey on his travels. One could assume he tries to fix the harm he did and seeks for friends to help him on this mission.
