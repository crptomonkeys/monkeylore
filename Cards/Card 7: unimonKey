Card 7: unimonKey - Mythical monkey who can build connections between the monKey worlds. He’s usually spending his time jumping around the monKeyverse by tearing holes in it. He often does this to visit his many friends he’s made over his long years. Mischief and adventure often follow the unimonKey as monKeys from different monKey Worlds come into contact with each other.
