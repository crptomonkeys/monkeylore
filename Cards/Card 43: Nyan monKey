Card 43: Nyan monKey - Some say that if you catch the Nyan monKey and follow its’ rainbow, it’ll lead you to a pot of gold. He enjoys his freedom but he can be somewhat evil minded, too, if you dare him. Most of all he fears to be put back into the pot which he escaped from. Few monKeys can tell the tale of the Nyan monKey’s anger and even fewer can tell about the generosity that comes with befriending such a monKey.
