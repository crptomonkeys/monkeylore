Within the monKeyverse there supposedly exists 19 monKey Worlds. No one knows how these worlds came to be, but one creation myth says that when the Big Banano was unwrapped, everything came into existence.

monKey Worlds:

Halloween World - Halloween World is stuck in a never-ending Halloween. Mysterious forces conspired and caused Halloween to never end in this world. This also brought to life all the creatures of Halloween from myth and legend. There are two separate factions of monKeys on this world; one group seeks to end the never-ending Halloween and the other’s goal is to prolong it indefinitely.

Modern monKey World - The most densely populated of all the known monKey Worlds. This monKey World is a thriving monKey civilization that has reached modernity. The monKeys of this world have a limitless future ahead of them, but they struggle with how best to move forward as a monKey civilization. 

Meme World - The monKey World where the memes, milestones, and culture of the community comes to life. These are immortalized into various monKeys by the monKeyprinters. However, some of the denizens of this monKey World are capable of impacting the monKeyverse in more dangerous ways than originally anticipated.

Pendulum world - The combination of two separate monKey Worlds conjoined together by some unknown means. They are total opposites of one another; one is stuck in a perpetual cycle of decay and the other in a permanent spiral of progress.

Holiday World - Homeworld of all the holiday and seasonal monKeys. They coexist in this world when it is not their holiday or season and usually get along fine with each other. Their unique ability is that they can interact with any monKey World when it is that world's holiday or season.

Space World - Space World is the home of the Banano Way Galaxy, which is home to many smaller worlds. These worlds are not full-fledged monKey Worlds - yet. The origin of these monKeys is a long forgotten secret, but tied to the other monKey Worlds.

Wizard World - Homeworld of all the monKey Wizard. Each of the monKey Wizards has a residence here even if some of them rarely use it. This world is seldom visited by monKeys as the ways to the Wizard World are not only secret, but fiercely guarded.

Card 88: Yellow Paper Printer

Card 1: monKeyprinter Go BRRR - The monKeyprinter is the creator of all of the monKeys, they are responsible for populating all of the monKey Worlds with monKeys. They are also said to reside at the center of the monKeyverse, where they still create new monKeys to this day. One story even mentions the possibility that there may be multiple monKeyprinters at work.

Card 2: The All-Nighter - This monkey never sleeps as long as there’s a trade or deal to be made. They’re now a part of a team of similarly-minded monkeys. Combining The All-Nighter's power of will with the other monKeys' connections and skills, it seems like nothing is beyond this group's grasp.

Card 3: To The Moon -This astronaut monkey is determined to be the first monKey to set foot on the moon. What he didn’t expect to find once he got there was a monKey already there, but it wasn’t the kind he was used too…

Card 4: DeFi Yield Farmer - Banano farmer who doesn’t do much, but it’s honest work. He comes from a long line of Banano farmers who have handed down their way of Defi Yield Farming. Now they’re working on a project with the Wrapped monKey to further compound his farming gains.

Card 5: This Is Fine - A monkey who is always calm and collected no matter the situation. He’s even prepared to watch the world burn down around him. Because. This. Is. Fine.

Card 6: monKey The Frog - Monkey who was bitten by a radioactive frog and gained super frog powers. They always hop into the scene exactly when they’re needed. They’ve been approached by the SupermonKey about forming a team to better protect their monKey World.

Card 7: unimonKey - Mythical monkey who can build connections between the monKey worlds. He’s usually spending his time jumping around the monKeyverse by tearing holes in it. He often does this to visit his many friends he’s made over his long years. Mischief and adventure often follow the unimonKey as monKeys from different monKey Worlds come into contact with each other.

Card 8: monKeydrop - Paratrooper monkey who brings Banano to those in need of potassium. He is considered to be one of the bravest and smartest monKey-agents ever but he has a secret no one knows of, his adopted stepbrother is a true hero, and he wants to be the same...

Card 9: supermonKey - A monkey who escaped to the modern monKey world from his dying world as a baby and was found adopted by banillionaires. He now spends his time protecting his new monKey world from any dangers. Especially the one that destroyed his original world.

Card 10: Banana Republic - The government of the Modern monKey World. Not much gets done here anymore, as they constantly argue over topics like whether “1 ban = 1 ban” is true or not. Not all monKeys are alright with the current state of the Banana Republic and are seeking to improve it from the inside.

Card 11: The Great Pampkin - Legend has it that The Great Pampkin is the reason Halloween World is stuck in a never-ending Halloween. As far as everyone in Halloween World knows, The Great Pampkin just appeared in the Pampkin Patch on Halloween night.

Card 12: Nifty Witch - She’s a real Nifty Witch as she helps out lost or adventurous monKeys on this Halloween night. Somehow she’s always brewing whatever it is that these monKeys need most. The catch is that she never parts with the contents of her cauldron without equal payment.

Card 13: Frankenstein’s monKey - Brought to life by bantastic but unscrupulous methods, this monKey is just trying to figure out where he belongs in this Halloween world. He may look a bit frightening at first, but deep down this monKey has a heart of Banano (literally). 

Card 14: monKey Brrrains - When the never-ending Halloween began some monKeys gained an irresistible taste for monKey brains. These roving hordes of undead monKeys pose a challenge to any monKeys trying to survive the night.

Card 15: monKey Krueger - No monkey is safe from monKey Krueger, even in their dreams. Some monKeys have tried to hole up and sleep out the never-ending Halloween only to find that their dreams may be scarier than the night itself.

Card 16: mummKey - The mummKey was awoken from her slumber in the ancient Banano Lands when the endless night began. Her untimely revival seems to be a side effect of whatever forces were used to start the never-ending Halloween. Now, she also seeks to end Halloween so that she can return to her slumber.

Card 17: The Yellow Ritual - Most of the monKeys on Halloween World have accepted that their world has been forever changed, yet some monKeys hold on to hope. Rumor has it that there may be a way to undo whatever caused this endless Halloween. The issue is that the only thing any monKey knows about this way to reverse the night is that it’s referred to as “The Yellow Ritual”.

Card 18: Never-Ending Halloween - It had seemed like another normal Halloween had gone by, but when every monKey awoke the next, they realized that the night had never ended. They also noticed that not only had the night not ended, but all of the creatures from myth and imagination had come into reality. Forever stuck at 19:19 PM, October 31st this world is now stuck in a never-ending Halloween.

Card 19: FUDbusters - When the never-ending Halloween started, everyone knew to call the FUDbusters to help fight the seemingly endless hordes of FUDsters. They use a set of Banano-powered Neutron packs to generate a Banano stream to counteract the FUD energy of any FUDsters.

Card 20: monKey King - Self proclaimed monkey king on a journey to the West. It is said he found a secret place on his way and released an ancient evil but he claims to never have seen any non-monKey on his travels. One could assume he tries to fix the harm he did and seeks for friends to help him on this mission.

Card 21: Sailor moonKey - Protector of her monKey World from the forces of darkness, she uses the power of the moon to transform into Sailor moonKey. It is an honor and a burden to protect a whole world all on her own but she was told by a wizard there would be others like here, somewhere…

Card 22: The monKeylorian - The only thing faster than his wit is his Banano blaster, both of which he uses to guard his young ward. He was assigned to find the mischievous being which escaped from the pot of gold, guarded by o’Patrick the monKey. This has turned out to be the monKeylorian’s hardest bounty yet.

Card 23: HODLOR! - Guardian of the Floor Door, he holds the line where other weaker handed predecessors have failed. Some even say without him the floor would be flooded with monsters like the paper hands or the skems. It is not known if he had this task since the beginning of the monKey world or if he was assigned by some wizardly being…

Card 24: monKey McDuck - Purportedly the richest banillionaire monkey there is, he even has a vault full of Bananos he likes to swim in. He has a soggy side to his heart, too, once he found a baby and adopted the little monKey who now helps to protect his father’s Banano to do good with it.

Card 25: ChREEEstmas monKey - The ChREEEstmas monKey was a normal monKey until he opened his present from monKey Claus and only found a big lump of coal. His ongoing anger might cause waves in the monKeyverse or not, monKey Claus doesn’t care which drives the ChREEEstmas monKey even more mad.

Card 26: monKey Claus - Every December monKey Claus distributes presents to good monKeys and coal to bad monKeys. He is a nice guy in general but he also lives totally for the moment, once his presents are delivered, a new year starts for him and he forgets about the past, be it for good or bad…

Card 27:  The Market Maker - Every monKey knows that if they ever need to sell or buy something, all they have to do is go to the Market Maker. He has a keen eye for analyzing deals as he knows how to best utilize the most valuable of monKey assets, Banano and stacks. He’s been working with a team of other money minded monKeys to spread his success to more monKeys.

Card 28: The Bounty Hunter - This monkey always completes the jobs he takes on, no matter how big or small they are. He has heard of some kind of bounty, bound to catching an evil thing but no one seems to know details, at least no monKey outside the bounty hunter guilds…

Card 29: New Year’s monKey (2021) - This monKey’s had a rough year, but he’s ready to bounce back and make the best of it. After monKeyClaus had visited him on Christmas and granted him that the new year could only turn out better than the last one he is full of hopium now.

Card 30: The Blue Wizard - First of the monKey Wizard’s Council, wielder of the blue flame. As the oldest of the wizards, it’s his job to lead and guide the rest of the monKey Wizard’s Council. He also trains and prepares new Wizards to protect the monKeyverse.

Card 31: The Pro-Waxxer - There was once an infamous scientist known as the Waxxer. They were constantly experimenting with Wax and what they could accomplish with it. Their last experiment was their boldest and most dangerous yet, causing consequences of unseen range…

Card 32: The Anti-Waxxer - The Waxxer attempted to fork himself. Unfortunately the Waxxer had failed to account for a rogue variable. Now there exists two versions of the Waxxer, with each seeking to complete the fork in their own way. His constant attempts to solve this alone nearly ripped his monKey world apart.

Card 33:  Planet of the monKeys - The long lost homeworld of all monKeys in the Banano Way Galaxy, legend has it that the planet is harboring a dark secret about the origin of all monKeys. It is said that creatures live on this world. Taller than a monKey, it is said their voice can drive a monKey crazy…

Card 34: The Expanse - Monkeys set out to distant planets in the Banano Way Galaxy to uncover a banspiracy older than monKeykind. Amongst them there are also the bravest of all the monKeyplorers, who dare to try to find the homeworld. The search alone is considered to be cursed…

Card 35: Serenifty - He fights for a cause that is already lost, but that won’t stop him from doing what he thinks is right. Hundreds of decades were spent on hiding the past of the monKeys’ origin, he wants to know the truth, no matter the cost.

Card 36: Miner monKey - Hardworking and honest Miner monKey, too bad he doesn’t know he only exists inside a game, although one could consider him as the happiest being in the entire monKeyverse. He knows nothing but mining on Planet Banance. Sometimes, though, there is a spark in the dark, evolving, when the monKey Miner is sleeping…

Card 37: monKey Miner - He spends all day guiding his in-game avatar, the Miner monKey to reap the most rewards he can. He designed Planet Banance to be an ongoing simulation that learns and sometimes, in his dreams, he sees the light in the dark, knowing he might be on to something truly yellow…

Card 38: Staking Queen - With her Bandragons at her side, nothing will stop her from spreading her stake all over this monKey World. She heard of a wandering monKey who is searching for help to ban an ancient evil but she has never left her mountains before…

Card 39:  Bull monKey - Once partners with the Bear monKey, he’s now wildly successful and on his way to the top. He tries not to look back and only follows the trends upwards to become a banillionaire. But deep in his thoughts he still knows about the bear and fears for him.

Card 40: The Green Wizard - Second of the monKey Wizard’s Council, assistant to the monKeyprinter. The Green Wizard is responsible for placing and distributing newly minted monKeys to where they belong. The Green Wizard once had an incident where they were overtaken by an evil entity, but was eventually saved by a team of diligent monKey detectives with the aid of a monKeyprinter.

Card 41: Bear monKey - Once partners with the Bull monKey, he’s suffered a series of setbacks and is approaching an all time low. Once he dreamed of becomming a banillionaire and now everything is lost. He just wishes he'd followed the advice of wiser monKeys…

Card 42: Hitchhiker monKey - The last surviving monkey of a destroyed monKey world. He knows about the ancient secrets of his own monKeyworld and could know the one thing that might decide the future of all monKeys. Unfortunately he has no control over the moments when he appears in monKey worlds…

Card 43: Nyan monKey - Some say that if you catch the Nyan monKey and follow its’ rainbow, it’ll lead you to a pot of gold. He enjoys his freedom but he can be somewhat evil minded, too, if you dare him. Most of all he fears to be put back into the pot which he escaped from. Few monKeys can tell the tale of the Nyan monKey’s anger and even fewer can tell about the generosity that comes with befriending such a monKey.

Card 44: Llama monKey - An unwitting monKey who doesn’t realize he's the in-game avatar for a popular real estate mogul game. Follow along with his misadventures in a cut-throat microcosm of of the Modern MonKey World.

Card 45:  O’Patrick The monKey - Ever since the Nyan monKey escaped his pot of gold he’s been following the rainbow trail hoping to get it back. He asked the monKeylorian for assistance in catching the evil spirit he let escape. The pot of gold seems a minor prize for the safety of the monKey world, even if no one knows he took it…

Card 46: 3rd Banniversary - This monKey surprised us all on this Banniversary by throwing an uncommonly good party before jumping out of the cake. Three years may not sound like much, but in the monKeyverse it is known that one year can be ten years and lots of things have happened of late…

Card 47: ClucKey - Which came first the ClucKey or the Cluckegg? This scientist tried to approach this age old question on the origin of monKeys with a new technique known as method researching - inspired by method acting - to better understand the nature of the monKeyverse. He might have lost his mind but he still owns the codes for some of the best guarded secrets on this monKeyworld.

Card 50: The Yellow Wizard - Third of the monKey Wizard’s Council, rumor has it he glimpsed the Yellow Formula and now has mastery over all things Banano. It is now the Yellow Wizard’s duty to ensure the Yellow Formula is fulfilled. He seems to mainly do this through the distribution of Banano across the monKeyverse.

Card 51:  Wrapped monKey - One day, everything this monKey touched instantly became wrapped. At first this seemed like a curse for this poor monKey as they constantly became tangled in messes of their own unfortunate making. However, they’ve recently been working with the Defi Yield Farmer on a way to wrap some of his crop.

Card 52: The Designer - With a little inspiration there’s nothing that this monKey can’t come up with.

Card 55: Doge Days - Nothing will stop this monKey from enjoying his summer with his doge buddy. He does not care about shill and rumors, he just respects others’ work and opinions and therefore lives the calmest life imaginable. Some say he gained this wisdom from the defender of floors himself…

Card 56: The Shill - A dimension-hopping monKey entity whose seemingly only purpose is to promote Banano and monKey culture across all the monKeyverse. Some myths even mention that the appearance of The Shill is always around times of great importance in monKey history. Could there be more to the Shill and its intentions than meets the eye?

Card 57: Buy The Dip - A banillionaire once heard the cries of the Shill and was persuaded to spend their fortunes buying the dip. Unfortunately, they took the phrase too literally…

It was an event like no other, written in the monKey history books forever.

Card 65: Banano Whale - The infamous Banano whale avoids capture from the persistent Captain Banab. He might be hunted but he is a friendly being, often rescuing drowning monKeys when the dip threatens the monKey world. Some say he is able to speak and is friends with the other ancient monKeys…

Card 66: neomonKey - This freshly minted monKey is enjoying his time in this sparsely populated monKey World. In some ways it is wonderous, seeing monKeys come to life from one moment to the next - or every now and then disappearing with a rainbow - but the neomonKey takes things as they come and go, without judging them.

Card 67: Tricked monKey - He was tricked and doesn’t deserve to be here, but he will find a way out. His comrades left him behind when they tried to rob the banillionaire monKey mcDuck, but he won’t rat on them.

Card 68: Count Bancula - When the Halloween began, Count Bancula rejoiced as he no longer had to hide his true nature inside his bansion.

Personally, DYOR monKey is on the search for a way to reverse what happened to his brother.

Card 73: Abominable monKey - Despite his unfortunate name, this monKey is anything but abominable; he does his best to help out any monKey he runs across. He is a good example that you should not judge a monKey by its fur, as his friend UnimonKey would tell you.
