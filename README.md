# monkeylore
Within the monKeyverse there supposedly exists 19 monKey Worlds. No one knows how these worlds came to be, but one creation myth says that when the Big Banano was unwrapped, everything came into existence.


This repo contains the official lore of the monKeyverse. It was originally written by mithc, and should be expanded over time by the community, as curated by our Lore Team.
You are welcome and encouraged to contribute lore ideas as Issues on this repository, following the Issue Template. With the approval of the Lore Team, your ideas may be added to the official lore.
